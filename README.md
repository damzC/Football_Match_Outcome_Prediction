# Predicting Football Match Outcomes

# Introduction
This Python notebook provides a comprehensive solution for predicting soccer match outcomes using various machine learning models. It includes data preparation, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and explanation.

# Features
- Uses a variety of data sources, including CSV files and Google Sheets.
- Performs extensive data cleaning and pre-processing.
- Implements various feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for prediction.
- Trains and evaluates four different classification models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Provides detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Utilizes LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain the predictions of the Random Forest and XGBoost models.
- Demonstrates how to update the trained models incrementally using Dask-ML.

# Feature Selection Techniques:

1. **High Correlation**: Features with a high correlation coefficient (either positive or negative) are identified and considered for selection.
2. **Low Multicollinearity**: Features that exhibit low multicollinearity are preferred to avoid redundancy and potential issues with model overfitting.
3. **High Chi-Square and F-Regression**: Features with high chi-square and F-regression values indicate a strong association with the target variable and are considered for selection.
4. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**: Features with a low VIF value (less than 10) are preferred to avoid multicollinearity issues.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
